# Introduction

Caido is a new lightweight web security auditing toolkit.
It can be installed on your own computer or on any VPS you own.
We are currently in private beta, so feel free to register on [our main site](https://caido.io).

## Caido storage folder

All the data Caido creates is stored in a single folder.
It can be moved to another computer, but you might encounter license issues (we are working on that).
